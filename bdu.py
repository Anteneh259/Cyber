# Example 2: Basic Arithmetic and Variables

# Assign values to variables
a = 5
b = 3

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = a + b  # addition
difference = a - b  # subtraction
product = a * b     # multiplication
quotient = a / b    # division

# Print the results
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference}")
print(f"Product: {product}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient}")
